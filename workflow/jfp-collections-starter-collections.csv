Highsmith (Carol M.) Archive,https://www.loc.gov/collections/carol-m-highsmith/,"Would need to be filtered by place since it captures projects outside of D.C. Given how Highsmith organized/labeled these images, we could (for the most part) safely do a ""if D.C. in XXX:"" from the ""subject_headings"" field or ""title"" field (the latter seems easier as it's less nested).
