He sees more than 10 boys chasing a Jewish boy and intervenes, first with dialogue; then with a little speech. His main points are that we are ""all"" Americans and that just one American's blood is as good as another, all our religions are equally to be respected. (The film was made to oppose anti-Semitism and racial prejudice at the end of World War II.) Sinatra sings two songs : ""If you are but a dream"" (words and music by Moe Jaffe, Jack Fulton, Nat Bonx; melody based on Anton Rubinstein's ""Romance in E flat, Op. 44, No. 1,"" popularly known as ""Rubenstein's Romance"") and ""The house I live in"" (music by Earl Robinson, lyrics by Lewis Allan).

Built in 1909-11, it was designed by Wallace A. Rayfield, a graduate of Howard University and Pratt Institute, and the first African-American to establish an architectural practice in Birmingham. The church was erected in an eclectic style reminiscent of Byzantine and Romanesque forms by successful African-American contractor Thomas C. Windham.  Located downtown near the former center of the African-American business district, Sixteenth Street Church has been known throughout its history as ""everybody's church."" Many distinguished Americans such as Langston Hughes, Paul Robeson, Jackie Robinson, Marian Anderson, Mary McLeod Bethune, and W.E.B. DuBois were heard there. The church began to receive national attention in 1963 when it became the principle site for organizing civil rights demonstrations led by the Reverends Fred Shuttlesworth and Martin Luther King, Jr. The Bombing of Sixteenth Street Baptist Church that killed four young girls attending Sunday School resulted in the national and international condemnation of segregation.  | Unprocessed Field note material exists for this structure: N270  | Building/structure dates: 1909-1911 Initial Construction  | Building/structure dates: after 1923 Subsequent Work  | Building/structure dates: after 1963 Subsequent Work  | National Register of Historic Places NRIS Number: 80000696  | Survey number: HABS AL-898  | Building/structure dates: 1991-1992 Subsequent Work ",Pdf | Image,"Photo, print, drawing",prints and photographs division | american memory | historic american buildings survey/historic american engineering record/historic american landscapes survey,"Library of Congress Prints and Photographs Division Washington,      D.C. 20540 USA http://hdl.loc.gov/loc.pnp/pp.print",36.0,"HABS ALA,37-BIRM,33-",religions | baptist churches | civil rights | religious facilities | african americans,2018-12-14T22:10:22.512Z,"Sixteenth Street Baptist Church, 1530 Sixth Avenue North, Birmingham, Jefferson County, AL",https://www.loc.gov/item/al0966/,"Ferguson, James N | King, Martin Luther, Jr | Lowe, Jet | Knyviene, Daina | L.

The impact of Carnegie's grant program on the development of public libraries cannot be overstated.  He came of age in an era when libraries were rare, privately funded institutions and access was through subscription. Believing in the power of libraries to create an egalitarian society that favored hard work over social privilege by allowing for equal access to knowledge, between 1886 and 1917 he provided forty million dollars for the construction of 1,679 libraries throughout the nation.  The vast resources that he allotted to library research and construction contributed significantly to the development of the American Library as a building type.  In addition, by insisting that municipalities supply a building site, books, and annual maintenance funds before bestowing grants Carnegie elevated libraries from the arena of private philanthropy to that of civic responsibility.  Philadelphia was the recipient of one of the largest Carnegie grants for library construction.  Although the city was among the first to establish a free library system, it had no purpose-built structures prior to the Carnegie endowment.  Under the direction of the city's appointed Carnegie Fund Committee, the branch libraries were built between 1905 and 1930 and designed by a ""who's-who"" of Philadelphia's architects.  The twenty extant branch libraries remain as a remarkable intact and cohesive grouping, rivaled only by that of New York City, with fifty-seven. Passyunk Branch was designed by well-known architect John T. Windrim, who went on to design two more branch library buildings and to serve on the Library Board.  It is among the smaller and less elaborate of the libraries, yet it is a classic example of the somewhat staid Beaux Arts form that came to define Carnegie branch libraries.  It follows the usual plan to consist of a rectangular main block with a rear ell to create a T-shaped configuration.  The lot on which the Passyunk Branch sits was provided to the city of Philadelphia by the estate of national renowned Philadelphia merchant, banker, and philanthropist, Stephan Girard.  Girard established a working farm here on what was then the countryside.  His former residence stills occupies a plot of land a short distance from the library that serves as a city park.  | Survey number: HABS PA-6762  | Building/structure dates: 1914 Initial Construction ",Pdf | Image,"Photo, print, drawing",prints and photographs division | american memory | historic american buildings survey/historic american engineering record/historic american landscapes survey,"Library of Congress Prints and Photographs Division Washington,      D.C. 20540 USA http://hdl.loc.gov/loc.pnp/pp.print",9.0,HABS PA-6762,libraries,2018-12-15T01:47:22.003Z,"Free Library of Philadelphia, Passyunk Branch, 1935 Shunk Street, Philadelphia, Philadelphia County, PA",https://www.loc.gov/item/pa4080/,"Windrim, John Torrey | Historic American Buildings Survey | Preservation Alliance of Greater Philadelphia | Carnegie, Andrew",architect | creator | sponsor | Unknown,Pennsylvania | Philadelphia County | Pennsylvania -- Philadelphia County -- Philadelphia | Philadelphia,Pennsylvania -- Philadelphia County -- Philadelphia | libraries,Philadelphia County | Pennsylvania | Philadelphia,"Philadelphia County, Pennsylvania, United States | Pennsylvania, United States | Philadelphia, Philadelphia County, Pennsylvania, United States",https://www.openstreetmap.org/relation/417845 | https://www.openstreetmap.org/relation/162109 | https://www.openstreetmap.org/relation/188022,40.0114538 | 40.9699889 | 39.9527237,-75.1326504 | -77.7278831 | -75.1635262,Philadelphia County | Unknown | Philadelphia County,Unknown | Unknown | Unknown,Pennsylvania | Pennsylvania | Pennsylvania,United States | United States | United States,,"Free Library of Philadelphia, Thomas F.

In this interview they discuss growing up on dairy farms; their approach to maintaining small size through efficiency and self-sufficiency; raising their son Bronson on the farm; their cheese curd operation, which they began in 2009; dairy co-ops and milk prices; the importance of pasturing cows; changes in the 4-H program; their views on farm size; the changing face of farmland in Lewis County, including Amish and Mennonite farmers; and other topics. Their farm was formerly operated by Joe's father, Tom Shultz, who was also interviewed for this project: see Interview afc2012033_00503. Joe was raised on the farm from the age of 10; Sue grew up on larger dairy farm in nearby Copenhagen, New York. They expressed optimism that small farms can survive, and talked about not wanting to expand their 40 cow herd. They talk about their love of farming and the farm life. They describe their tie-stall barn and pipeline milking system and milking twice daily. They spread solid manure daily and practice rotational grazing from April-October. They crop 50 acres of corn, 15 of alfalfa grasses, and 60 acres of hay, and practice crop rotation. They utilize two upright silos for corn silage and one for haylage. The Shultzes make cheese curd twice weekly, turning about 1/3 of their milk into cheese. They sell the rest of their milk to a dairy co-op. The farm's name, Ara-Kuh, was created by Joe's parents: Ara comes from Arabia, in Delaware County, New York, where Tom and Peggy Shultz lived before moving to Lowville; Kuh is the German word for cow.",,
